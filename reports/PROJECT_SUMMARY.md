# Railway Track Defect Detection - Project Summary

**Author:** Vigneshwari Jayaprakash  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Executive Summary

End-to-end machine learning system for detecting railway track defects using YOLO11s object detection. Achieved 48.2% mAP@50 (5.6 point improvement over baseline) with enhanced recall (51.1%) through iterative development and augmentation strategies.

## Final Performance

| Metric | V1 | V2 | Improvement |
|--------|----|----|-------------|
| mAP@50 | 42.6% | **48.2%** | +5.6 pts |
| Recall | 41.3% | **51.1%** | +9.8 pts |
| Training Time | 40 min (25 epochs) | 5.4 hrs (63 epochs) | 8x longer |

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ Built complete ML pipeline (data → train → deploy)
2. ✅ Demonstrated iterative improvement (V1 → V2)
3. ✅ Implemented three-tier confidence system
4. ✅ Created production-ready dashboard
5. ✅ Comprehensive error analysis and documentation

## Production Readiness

**Status:** Ready for human-assisted deployment

**Recommended Use:** Pre-screening tool with human verification for all alerts.

**Not Recommended:** Autonomous safety-critical decisions without oversight.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Transfer learning & fine-tuning
- Data augmentation strategies
- Precision/recall trade-off analysis
- Interactive dashboard development
- Production deployment considerations
